    <!--
    
        DESCRIPTION:
            This is a sample integration to the Sage Payment Solutions Web Services.
            The Web Services expose a robust set of gateway functionality, while allowing
            the integrator to use their own UIs to collect the customer's data.
        
        TECHNICAL:
            This was created on a Linux server running PHP version 5.5.16.
            Your PHP installation will need SOAP and SimpleXML enabled.
            Call phpinfo() to see information about your configuration.
        
        SUPPORT:
            I've done my best to add comments throughout these files. That said, it is 
            not possible to exhaustively anticipate and address every potential scenario 
            that may arise! Please email sdksupport@sage.com for assistance integrating to 
            the Web Services, or any other questions involving third-party integrations to the 
            Sage Payment Solutions gateway. Any code snippets, logs, responses, etc. 
            that you can provide make troubleshooting much easier, and are appreciated.
        
        TERMS OF USE:
            This sample was created for demonstrative purposes only. Please do not provide
            these files, their content, Web Service documentation, or any other relevant material 
            to any parties not directly involved with your integration.
